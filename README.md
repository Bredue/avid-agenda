# AVID Agenda

A fast and lightweight web app to make creating, storing, and displaying classroom agendas a breeze.

Local storage in the web browser is utilized to store classroom agendas for an AVID school without requiring a user to sign in or authenticate. Everything is local, meaning as long as the user is using the same device and doesn't clear their history they will have access to the data they create at all times.
