# AVID Agenda

Check out the project [here](https://bredue.github.io/avid-agenda/)

A fast and lightweight web app to make: creating, storing, and displaying classroom agendas a breeze.

Local storage in the web browser is utilized to store classroom agendas for an AVID school without requiring a user to sign in or authenticate. Everything is local, meaning as long as the user is using the same device and doesn't clear their history they will have access to the data they create at all times.

*Note: If using firefox make sure that strict privacy settings are disables so that local storage can be utilized. The app cannot be used in incognito mode and will lose all data if the user clears their history, re-downloads their web browser or switches devices.
